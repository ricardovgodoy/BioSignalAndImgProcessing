✅ **Variable names** - Kept as-is (not translated)
✅ **Code logic** - Completely unchanged
✅ **Code outputs** - Completely unchanged

### Translation Method

- Automated translation using comprehensive Portuguese-English dictionary
- 300+ translation entries covering common phrases, technical terms, and grammar patterns
- Multiple refinement passes to improve quality
- Translation scripts included for future maintenance

### Quality Notes

⚠️ **Important**: While all files have been translated, the quality is functional but NOT professional-grade:
- Some mixed Portuguese/English remains in complex sentences
- Grammar may not be perfect in all cases
- Recommended: Professional bilingual review before official use

See `TRANSLATION_STATUS.md` for detailed quality assessment and improvement recommendations.
