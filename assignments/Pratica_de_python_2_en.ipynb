    "# **Training a Random Forest model to classify different gesture classes using EMG signals as input**\n\nIn this practice, EMG data will be provided to be used as input to train a classical machine learning model called Random Forest.\n\nEight bipolar EMG electrodes were used to measure myoelectric activations and acquire EMG signals. Signals were acquired at a sampling rate of 1,200 Hz using a g.tec g.USBamp bioamplifier, which applied a Butterworth band-pass filter (5 Hz – 500 Hz). Power-line noise was removed using a 50 Hz notch filter. The user performed four grasp types for offline data collection. These gestures were selected so that the hand could perform the most common gestures used to pick up a bowl. For each gesture, the participant started with 10 seconds of rest, during which the hand remained completely relaxed, followed by 10 seconds performing the gesture. Visual cues were provided through a 3-second countdown shown on a computer screen, indicating transitions between gesture and rest states.\n\nThe files below will be downloaded from Google Drive in the code cells.\nThere are four files:\n\n* **X_train**: Model input used for training. It contains EMG signals that will be used as model input and learned for decoding. It contains 9 out of 10 repetitions.\n* **X_test**: Model input used for testing. It contains EMG signals that will be used as model input and evaluated for performance. It contains 1 out of 10 repetitions, i.e., the repetition not seen during training.\n* **Y_train**: Contains labels/classes for the corresponding training input data. Labels are one of the 4 gestures or rest. Total: 5 classes.\n* **Y_test**: Contains labels/classes for the corresponding test input data. Labels are one of the 4 gestures or rest. Total: 5 classes.\n\nInput data has shape `(number_of_samples, 8, 200, 1)`, while output data has shape `(number_of_samples, 1)`.\nTo provide this data to a Random Forest model using the implementation provided, you need to reshape it to `(number_of_samples, 16000)` using `-1`, as follows: `(-1, 16000)`.\nData is already balanced and filtered.\n\nNext, you will receive a few tasks, but first let’s load the data:"
