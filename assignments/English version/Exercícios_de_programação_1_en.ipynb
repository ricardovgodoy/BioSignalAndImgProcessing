    "# **Filter Project**\n\nIn this practice, we will **compare the performance of different filters**, both in the time domain and in the frequency domain.\n\nWe start by cloning the files we will use in this practice:\n\n* `ecg2x60.dat` contains an ECG contaminated by 60 Hz artifacts from the power line. This signal was acquired at 200 Hz.\n* `ecg_hfn.dat` contains ECG signals acquired at 1000 Hz and includes high-frequency noise.\n* `ecg_lfn.dat` contains low-frequency artifacts and has a sampling frequency of 1000 Hz.\n\nIn the last classes, you learned several signal filtering techniques.\n\nAs you remember (or should remember), several techniques can be used for the same type of problem. For example:\n\n* **High-frequency noise** can be attenuated with low-pass filters, synchronous averaging, and even moving average.\n* **Low-frequency noise** can be attenuated with derivative filters and high-pass filters.\n* **Structured noise or line noise** can be attenuated with notch filters.\n\nTime-domain filters can be applied without requiring spectral characterization of the signal and noise. However, these filters are not designed to process specific frequencies. For that purpose, we can use frequency-domain filters.\n\nIn this practice, you will apply filters to each available ECG signal. You may use any filters and as many as needed. For some signals, you will need to use more than one type of filter to remove more than one type of noise. The order in which you apply filters can influence the final result.\n\nTo discover which filters to use, you will need to test.\n\n**In this practice, I have already implemented all filters. Use them by uncommenting the relevant lines and replacing the required parameters indicated by emojis.**\n\n**The first cell contains everything you need. You can use it as a draft to test implementations. In the second cell, provide your final answer, where you place the final, clean, and organized code.**\n\n**Remember that this practice is graded and must be submitted in Canvas.**\n\n**Any changes you make in this notebook will not be saved automatically.**\n\n**So, I recommend going to \"File\" > \"Save a copy in Drive\".**\n\nNow you can freely make changes and they will be saved.\n\n**The file saved in your Drive will probably be named \"Exercícios de programação 1.ipynb\" or something similar, and may be inside a folder called \"Colab Notebooks\".**\n\n**The grade is by group, but every member of the group must submit the assignment. Since this is a group activity, the file submitted by members of the same group should obviously be the same. However, exactly identical files submitted by members of different groups will result in a grade of 0.**\n\nThis assignment counts as a complementary activity grade.\n\nGood luck!"
